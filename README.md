This project presents the development and evaluation of a spam email classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The classifier is designed to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) emails based
on textual content. The implementation utilizes the Scikit-learn library in Python and follows a structured approach including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
The dataset comprises email messages labeled as spam or ham. Initially, text data from the emails are preprocessed and transformed into numerical features using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
vectorization method. This conversion facilitates the application of machine learning algorithms to text data.
In this project, we develop an email spam classifier using SVM to automate the detection of spam emails. The classifier is built using the Scikit-learn library in Python, leveraging its comprehensive suite of tools
for machine learning and data preprocessing.
